### Day 2: May 21, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Revised the OSI model, learnt how to define session and presentation layer for interviews...

**Thoughts:** Good revision, feel like session presentation layer is not that important for college, since it's rarely spoken about, but might be useful for interviews for network engineering roles. Glad I found Hussein Nasser's playlist

### Day 1: May 20, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started Gaurav Sen's playlist of System Design, learned about Load Balacing, Consistent Hashing and Monolithic architecture vs Microservices architecture.

**Thoughts:** Good start, I wanna try and be able to think for myself and come up with my own solution during system design interviews. Gaurav Sen's Playlist looks like a good place to start

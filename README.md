# 100-days-of-code

### Day 1: May 20, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started Gaurav Sen's playlist of System Design, learned about Load Balacing, Consistent Hashing and Monolithic architecture vs Microservices architecture.

**Thoughts:** Good start, I wanna try and be able to think for myself and come up with my own solution during system design interviews. Gaurav Sen's Playlist looks like a good place to start
